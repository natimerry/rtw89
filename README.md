# rtw89

## Supported chips
- **PCIe**: RTL8851BE, RTL8852AE, RTL8852BE, RTL8852CE, RTL8922AE
- **USB** : RTL8851BU(**NEW**)

## Prerequisites

git, make, gcc, kernel-headers, dkms and mokutil (dkms and mokutil are optional.)

## Installation Guide

1. Create a clone of this repo in your local machine

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/a5a5aa555oo/rtw89
   ```

2. Change the working directory to rtw89

   ```
   cd rtw89
   ```

3. Search and remove other out-of-kernel rtw89 drivers. If your system has [Larry's rtw89 driver](https://github.com/lwfinger/rtw89) installed, you must run this command to remove it, or this driver won't work as expected.

   ```
   sudo make cleanup_target_system
   ```

3. Build and install the driver

   * _via dkms (Recommended especially Secure Boot is enabled on your system)_

     ```
     sudo dkms install $PWD
     ```

   * _via make_

     ```
     make clean modules && sudo make install
     ```

4. Install the firmware necessary for the driver

   ```
   sudo make install_fw
   ```


6. Enroll the MOK (Machine Owner Key). This is needed **ONLY IF** [Secure Boot](https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot) is enabled on your system. Please see [this guide](https://github.com/dell/dkms?tab=readme-ov-file#secure-boot) for details.

   ```
   sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/dkms/mok.pub
   ```

   For Ubuntu-based distro users, run this command instead.

   ```
   sudo mokutil --import /var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der
   ```

## Uninstallation Guide

For users who installed the driver via `DKMS`, run
```
sudo dkms remove rtw89/6.15 --all
```
```
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/dkms/rtw89
```
```
sudo rm -rf /usr/src/rtw89-6.15
```
```
sudo rm -f /etc/modprobe.d/rtw89.conf
```

For users who installed the driver via `make`, run this command in the rtw89 source directory
```
sudo make uninstall
```

## Note

Kernel 6.6 ~ 6.14 are supported. For kernel 5.15 ~ 6.5 users, use the rtw89 driver in [6.6-lts branch](https://github.com/a5a5aa555oo/rtw89/tree/6.6-lts) instead.

Tested with RTL8852BE on Arch Linux (kernel version: 6.6.83-1-lts66 / 6.12.19-1-lts) and it works.

## Known Issues

1. [8922AE: Spam messges and disconnection occasionally](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/ae5013a930574e68b96544df82f93157@realtek.com/T/#me15f16d0cd4cf85b3317ffb3bc1303b9e85402e7)

## Q&A

### Q1. Bluetooth is still not working after installing this driver, why?

   The `rtw89` driver is the **Wi-Fi** driver for Realtek Wi-Fi 6/7 adapters and has nothing to do with Bluetooth.

### Q2. How to update the driver installed via DKMS?

   1. Remove the rtw89 driver completely. Please see [Uninstallation Guide](#uninstallation-guide) for details.

   2. Run this command in the rtw89 source directory to pull the latest code
      ```
      git pull
      ```

   3. Build and install the rtw89 driver from the latest code.
      ```
      sudo dkms install $PWD
      ```

### Q3. How to update the driver installed via `make`?

   1. Run this command in the rtw89 source directory to pull the latest code
      ```
       git pull
      ```
  
   2. Rebuild and reinstall the driver
      ```
      make clean modules && sudo make install
      ```
